A simple webapp to browse recipes.
I had an idea to make a website to browse new recipes each day but I didn't find a suitable API that was free to use so this is what i ended up with.

Made using Food2Fork APIf
https://www.food2fork.com/about/api

App can be used at https://k44rel.github.io/FoodFeed/ (limited to 50 API calls per day)
